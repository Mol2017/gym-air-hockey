# OpenAI Gym Environment Wrapper for [Air Hockey Game Simulator](https://github.com/arakhmat/air-hockey)

I would recommend using Anaconda3 Python distribution because that's the only environment the program was tested in. You can download it from: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
## Installing
Clone the repository and install it as a python module:
```
git clone https://github.com/arakhmat/gym-air-hockey
